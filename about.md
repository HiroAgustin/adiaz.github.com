I’ve been building stuff on the web for about 8 years, working remotely for a few startups for the past 3.

Before that I was a participant at [The Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) where I got to improve on my skills alongside some of the nicest, most talented people I’ve ever met.

I started my career developing E-Commerce stores on NetSuite, later got acqu-hired and helped build from scratch the [SuiteCommerce](http://www.netsuite.com/portal/products/suitecommerce.shtml) platform.

On my spare time I’m either reading tech books, bingeing something on Netflix, cycling on the [promenade](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294323-d2233045-r196103509-Rambla_de_Montevideo-Montevideo_Montevideo_Department.html), or playing video (or board) games.

My online handle *HiroAgustin* is a reference to the lovable spacetime traveling programmer/samurai [Hiro Nakamura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiro_Nakamura) and a nod to my gaming days.

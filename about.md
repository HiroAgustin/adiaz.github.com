I’ve been building stuff on the web for about 8 years, working remotely with startups for the past 3. Some of my responsibilities included: designing and implementing a SPA for orders handling, improving upon a data visualization library, and migrating a vanilla JS codebase to React.

Before that I was a participant at [The Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) where I got to improve on my skills alongside some of the nicest, most talented people I’ve ever met.

Originally I developed E-Commerce sites on NetSuite, then got acquired and helped build from scratch their [SuiteCommerce Advanced](http://www.netsuite.com/portal/products/suitecommerce.shtml) platform.

<!-- <p class="Message">I’m currently looking for the opportunity to join a new team full-time.</p> -->

On my spare time I’m either reading a tech book, bingeing something on Netflix, cycling on the [promenade](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294323-d2233045-r196103509-Rambla_de_Montevideo-Montevideo_Montevideo_Department.html), or playing video (or board) games.

My online handle *HiroAgustin* is a reference to the lovable spacetime traveling programmer/samurai [Hiro Nakamura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiro_Nakamura) and a nod to my gaming days.

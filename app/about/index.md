title: About Me
---

My name is Agustín Díaz, but you can find me in most places as HiroAgustin. The name “Hiro” comes from my gaming days, and it’s a reference to the lovable time traveling programmer/samurai [Hiro Nakamura](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiro_Nakamura).

## The Web is The Platform

I’ve been doing web development all of my professional life and it’s been amazing to see how much the web has grown. Browsers are now constantly releasing new features and API’s, and the community is building an incredible amount of tools and libraries to take advantage of them. It is a great time to be a web developer.

I’m passionate about the vanilla web stack, but to build rich applications, frameworks are usually the way to go. Some of the ones I’ve worked with include jQuery, Backbone, Jasmine, Express, Grunt, Bootstrap, and Sass. You can check out my resume [here](/resume/).

## Leisure

I’m a big fan of TV, from “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.” to “The Newsroom”. Also, the gamer in me hasn’t died yet (although I own a Mac). Recently I’ve been playing anything from “Telltale Games”. To fight sedentarism, I started doing more exercise by going for a jog a couple of times a week.

title: About Me
---

My name is Agustín Díaz and I’m a web developer. My moniker is HiroAgustin, inspired from my gaming days and it’s a reference to the lovable time traveling programmer/samurai [Hiro Nakamura](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiro_Nakamura).

The most enjoyable part of being a web developer is the open community, I enjoy reading articles, going to meetups, and seeing how passionate everyone is about the internet. It's nothing short of amazing. I started out working at SuiteCommerce, implementing customized web stores on top of the NetSuite platform. Two and a half years later the company was acquired and I moved from building websites into building NetSuite’s new ECommerce platform.

Outside work I’m a big fan of TV, from “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.” to “The Newsroom”, I watch it all. Also I’ve been playing anything from “Telltale Games”.

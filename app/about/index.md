title: About Me
---

My name is Agustín, and I’m a web developer.

The most enjoyable part of being a web developer is the open community. I enjoy reading articles, going to meetups, and seeing how passionate everyone is about the internet. It's nothing short of amazing.

My online handle, HiroAgustin, is a reference to the lovable time traveling programmer/samurai Hiro Nakamura and a nod to my gaming days.

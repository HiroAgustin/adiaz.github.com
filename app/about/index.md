title: About Me
---

My name is Agustín, and I’m a web developer.

The most enjoyable part of being a web developer is the open community. I enjoy reading articles, going to meetups, and seeing how passionate everyone is about the internet. It's nothing short of amazing. I started out working at SuiteCommerce, implementing customized web stores on top of the NetSuite platform. Two and a half years later the company was acquired and I moved from building websites into building NetSuite’s new eCommerce platform.

Outside work I’m a big fan of TV: from Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. to The Newsroom, I watch it all. I'll also play anything from Telltale Games. My online handle, HiroAgustin, is a reference to the lovable time traveling programmer/samurai Hiro Nakamura and a nod to my gaming days.

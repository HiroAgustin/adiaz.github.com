I wasn’t sure what to write about for my first blog post. After spending a few weeks obsessed with the site itself, I figured *that* should make for a good enough topic. So… this is my stack.

## Blogging

First thing to choose was the platform. [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) was an overkill and [Medium](https://medium.com/) wasn’t personal enough. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) looked like the perfect fit from day one, some of the reasons why I chose it were:

* It is in Ruby, which is outside of my comfort zone.
* It is database-less, which I’m very fond of.
* I can write in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), which I think it’s cool.
* I have control over everything, which I need.

It didn’t hurt to know that [Github Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/) are powered by Jekyll, meaning free hosting and support.

## Workflow

I’m a huge fan of [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). Without getting into the [grunt vs gulp](http://markdalgleish.github.io/presentation-build-wars-gulp-vs-grunt/) discussion, it just was easier for me to learn and use. I found an [amazing yeoman generator](https://github.com/robwierzbowski/generator-jekyllrb) that I tweaked into my needs. The task I’m impressed by the most is [build-control](https://github.com/robwierzbowski/grunt-build-control), which deploys the built version of my site hustle free.

## Styles

I drew inspiration from the blogs of developers I look up to. Some of them are: [Nicolas Gallagher](http://nicolasgallagher.com/), [Brad Frost](http://bradfrost.com/blog/), [Harry Roberts](http://csswizardry.com/), [Dave Rupert](http://daverupert.com/), [Addy Osmani](http://addyosmani.com/blog/), [Mark Otto](http://markdotto.com/) and many more.

The css architecture is a mix of [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) and [SUIT CSS](http://suitcss.github.io/), using a single config file to store the global variables. I’m also using some [flexbox tricks](http://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/) and [pretty colors](http://clrs.cc/).

## Content

One thing that bothered me about Jekyll is the [file naming convention](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#creating-post-files) for posts. So I wrote a yeoman generator that scaffolds out posts, drafts and pages. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/HiroAgustin/generator-jekyll-utils).

## Source

Everything is up on GitHub, [source](https://github.com/HiroAgustin/adiaz.github.com) and [distribution](https://github.com/HiroAgustin/adiaz.github.com/tree/gh-pages). Feel free to snoop around and please [let me know](http://twitter.com/HiroAgustin) if there is something you would like to know more about.
